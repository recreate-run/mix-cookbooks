# Mix Cookbooks - Webapp Integration Examples

## Core Philosophy: Integration, NOT Standalone Apps

**Problem with Previous Approach**:
- Research Agent = standalone chat interface
- Mix Playground already does this
- Doesn't show how to integrate AI into existing webapps

**New Approach**:
- Show how to ADD AI to existing webapp types
- Each example = working webapp + AI enhancement
- Focus on practical patterns developers can copy
- Use Mix tools that can't be done with OpenAI alone

---

## The 3 Examples

### 1. CMS + AI Media Intelligence (NEW)
**File**: `01-cms-media-intelligence.md`
**Webapp**: Content management system with media library
**AI Features**:
- 📸 Smart image search by description
- 🏷️ Auto-tagging uploaded images
- ♿ Alt text generation for accessibility
- 🔍 Find visually similar images

**Mix Tools**: ReadMedia (vision), PythonExecution (similarity), Search (optional)
**Timeline**: 10-14 hours (Day 1-2)

---

### 2. Admin Panel + Data Intelligence (NEW)
**File**: `02-admin-data-intelligence.md`
**Webapp**: Typical admin dashboard with data tables
**AI Features**:
- 📊 CSV analysis (upload → insights + charts)
- 🔍 Anomaly explanation ("Why did signups drop?")
- 💬 Natural language queries
- 📈 Smart report generation

**Mix Tools**: ReadText (CSV), PythonExecution (pandas/matplotlib), ShowMedia (charts)
**Timeline**: 8-12 hours (Day 3-4)
**Key Highlight**: Shows AI-generated code ("You wrote 0 lines")

---

### 3. Shopping App + Autonomous Research (ENHANCEMENT)
**File**: `03-shopping-app-agentic-research.md`
**Webapp**: Existing shopping-app (already built)
**Enhancement**: Add autonomous web research mode

**AI Features**:
- 🔍 Web search for product reviews
- 📖 Read 5-10 review articles autonomously
- 📊 Sentiment analysis across sources
- 📈 Expert ratings aggregation
- 🔗 Cited recommendations (every claim sourced)

**Mix Tools**: Search + ReadText + PythonExecution + ShowMedia (ALL tools)
**Timeline**: 10 hours (Day 5)
**Key Highlight**: Two modes (fast specs vs thorough research)

---

## Why These 3?

**Different Webapp Types**:
1. CMS (content creators)
2. Admin Panel (universal - every app has one)
3. E-commerce (consumers)

**Different Mix Capabilities**:
1. Vision (ReadMedia) - unique to Mix
2. Code Execution (PythonExecution) - core differentiator
3. All Combined (Search + ReadText + Python + ShowMedia) - full workflow

**Progressive Complexity**:
1. CMS: Moderate (vision + similarity)
2. Admin: Intermediate (code execution + visualization)
3. Shopping: Advanced (complete autonomous workflow)

---

## Implementation Order

**Recommended**:
1. **Shopping-app enhancement** (Day 1) - Enhance what we have, show full workflow
2. **Admin Panel** (Day 2-3) - Universal pattern, showcase code execution
3. **CMS** (Day 4-5) - Vision capabilities, unique to Mix

**Rationale**:
- Start with shopping-app (already 80% done, just add research mode)
- Admin panel next (everyone needs this, clear "you wrote 0 lines" message)
- CMS last (most novel, shows vision capabilities)

**Alternative Order** (as originally planned):
1. CMS (Day 1-2) - User specifically requested
2. Admin (Day 3-4) - Universal pattern
3. Shopping enhancement (Day 5) - Flagship example with all tools

---

## Key Success Criteria

Each example must demonstrate:
1. ✅ **Integration into existing webapp** (not separate chat page)
2. ✅ **Autonomous tool use** (AI decides what to do)
3. ✅ **Real-time visibility** (user sees AI working)
4. ✅ **Impossible with OpenAI alone** (requires Mix tools)
5. ✅ **Practical for developers** (reusable patterns)

---

## Technical Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sidebar Modal (Shopping-app pattern)
```
Product Grid → Select Items → Button → Sidebar Opens → AI Analysis → Follow-ups
```
- Non-blocking (keeps context visible)
- Auto-start analysis on open
- Real-time streaming updates

### Pattern 2: Analysis Modal with Code Viewer
```
Data View → Upload CSV → Modal Opens → Shows AI Writing Code → Charts Appear
```
- Emphasizes "AI writes code"
- Collapsible code viewer
- Tool execution timeline

### Pattern 3: Enhanced Search
```
Search Bar → AI Toggle → Analyzes All Items → Ranked Results
```
- Works alongside traditional search
- Progressive enhancement
- Graceful fallback

## Mix Tools Showcase

| Tool | CMS | Admin | Shopping |
|------|-----|-------|----------|
| **Search** | Optional | ❌ | ✅ |
| **ReadText** | ❌ | ✅ CSV | ✅ Articles |
| **ReadMedia** | ✅ Images | ❌ | Optional |
| **PythonExecution** | ✅ Similarity | ✅ Analysis | ✅ Sentiment |
| **ShowMedia** | ✅ Grids | ✅ Charts | ✅ Charts |

**Coverage**:
- All examples use PythonExecution (core capability)
- CMS focuses on ReadMedia (vision)
- Admin focuses on code execution visibility
- Shopping uses ALL tools (complete workflow)

---

## Estimated Timeline

| Example | Development | Testing | Total |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| **CMS** | 8-10h | 2-4h | 10-14h |
| **Admin** | 6-8h | 2-4h | 8-12h |
| **Shopping** | 8h | 2h | 10h |
| **Total** | 22-26h | 6-10h | 28-36h |

**Approximately 5-7 working days**

---

## Deliverables Per Example

Each example includes:
1. ✅ Working webapp (realistic UI, not just demo)
2. ✅ 2 API routes (session, streaming)
3. ✅ Integration modal/sidebar
4. ✅ Real-time tool visibility
5. ✅ Code viewer (admin) or source list (shopping)
6. ✅ Follow-up questions capability
7. ✅ README with integration guide
8. ✅ Sample data/images for testing

---

## Key Messaging Framework

### What NOT to Say
❌ "AI-powered chat"
❌ "Smart assistant"
❌ "Conversational interface"
❌ "AI helps you write code"

### What TO Say
✅ "AI autonomously searches, reads, analyzes"
✅ "AI writes and executes code itself"
✅ "Multi-step autonomous workflow"
✅ "You wrote 0 lines, AI wrote 50+"
✅ "Can't do this with just OpenAI API"

## Marketing Angles

### CMS Example
**Headline**: "Add AI Image Search to Your CMS in 2 Hours"
**Hook**: Search by description ("sunset beach"), not just filename
**Proof**: Show 1000 images tagged in 10 minutes

### Admin Example
**Headline**: "I Added Data Analysis to My Admin Panel - AI Wrote All the Code"
**Hook**: Upload CSV → Insights in 30 seconds
**Proof**: Show collapsible code viewer with 80 lines of pandas/matplotlib

### Shopping Example
**Headline**: "AI That Doesn't Hallucinate - Every Claim Cited"
**Hook**: Compare products with real expert opinions, not just specs
**Proof**: Show sources list with 8 URLs, inline citations [1][2][3]

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Plans created (DONE)
2. ⏭️ Choose implementation order (shopping first OR CMS first)
3. ⏭️ Build first example (10-14 hours)
4. ⏭️ Demo video + README
5. ⏭️ Repeat for other 2 examples
